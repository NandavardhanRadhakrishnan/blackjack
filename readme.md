# Blackjack (single player)

A sample project for PPS 

Instructions:
This is a game where your goal is to get the 
number as close to 21 as possible without going over.
You will be given two sets of numbers to choose from and an option to payout
if you select any set of numbers a random number from the set will be added to the existing number
if you select payout your score will be calculated and added to your total score hence ending the game
your score is calculated based on how close you are to 21 if you go above 21 you will lose and your score will be subtracted from the total score

Scores:
To play one round of blackjack 100 points will be deducted from your total score
if you get exactly 21, 200 points in total will be rewarded
if you payout before 14 no points will be added to your score hence levaing you in loss of 100 points
if you get between 14 and 21 then the score will be calculated accordingly
